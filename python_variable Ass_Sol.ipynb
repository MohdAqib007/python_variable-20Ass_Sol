    "#Q1. Write all the conventions being followed while declaring a variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "'''In Python, there are several conventions that are typically followed when declaring variables. \n",
    "These conventions help to make code more readable and maintainable. Here are some of the most common conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use lowercase letters: Variable names should be in all lowercase letters, as this makes them easier to read and distinguish from class names.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Separate words with underscores: If a variable name consists of multiple words, separate them with underscores, e.g., my_variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use descriptive names: Variable names should be descriptive and indicate the purpose of the variable. Avoid using single letter names like x or y.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Avoid reserved keywords: Do not use reserved keywords like if, else, for, while, etc., as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use camelCase for class names: Class names should use CamelCase convention, which capitalizes the first letter of each word, e.g., MyClass.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use all uppercase letters for constants: Constants should be written in all uppercase letters, e.g., MY_CONSTANT.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Avoid starting with numbers: Variable names should not start with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to declare a variable following these conventions:'''\n",
    "\n",
    "# Declare a variable called 'my_variable'\n",
    "my_variable = 42\n",
    "\n",
    "#By following these conventions, your code will be more consistent and easier to read for yourself and others who may need to understand or modify your code.\n"
